# Implementation Tasks: Textbook Content

**Feature Branch**: `002-textbook-content` | **Date**: 2025-11-30
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/002-textbook-content/spec.md`
**Plan**: `specs/002-textbook-content/plan.md`

## Summary

This document outlines the actionable tasks for implementing the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Content" feature. Tasks are organized into phases, starting with setup, followed by foundational elements, and then individual user stories (P1-P6) in priority order. A final phase covers polish and cross-cutting concerns. Each task includes a unique ID, an optional parallelization marker, and the relevant file path.

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow a phased approach, focusing on delivering each user story as an independently testable increment. User Stories are ordered by priority (P1 being highest). An MVP for this feature would encompass completing Phase 1, Phase 2, and User Story 1 (P1).

- [ ] T060 Verify Docusaurus sidebar generation and navigation for all parts and chapters.
- [ ] T061 Ensure all chapter frontmatter (`title`, `description`, `sidebar_position`, `tags`) conforms to `specs/002-textbook-content/contracts/chapter-frontmatter.schema.json`.
- [ ] T062 Perform markdownlint check on all content files in `book/docs/`.
- [ ] T063 Conduct a final review of all content for academic integrity and clarity (FR-010).

## Dependencies

The user stories are generally sequential, with each building on the previous one.
- Phase 1 must be completed before Phase 2.
- Phase 2 must be completed before any User Story Phase.
- User Story N (P N) should ideally be completed before User Story N+1 (P N+1).

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

- Within each User Story phase, tasks that create distinct files (e.g., `intro.md`, `chapter-XX/index.md`) can be parallelized.
- The content creation for different chapters within the same Part can be done in parallel once the basic directory structure is set up.
